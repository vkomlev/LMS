# Testing Checks

## Coverage Depth
- Do tests cover changed behavior and key regressions?
- Are both happy path and failure path tested?
- Are boundary/edge conditions included?

## Test Quality
- Are tests deterministic and isolated?
- Are assertions meaningful (not only status-code level)?
- Do tests validate contracts, not implementation trivia?

## Practical Sufficiency
- Is there at least one fast smoke path for changed endpoint/flow?
- Are required commands clearly listed and executable?
